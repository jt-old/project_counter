# Celebrity Counter

This "celebrity counter" is a simple counting app that is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript where I learned more about:

- script tags
- variables numbers
- strings
- working with the DOM
- getElementById()
- innerText
- textContent
- importing custom fonts via @font-face

The theme is inspired by the classic I love Lucy episodes where Lucy and the gang drive out to Hollywood. Lucy is completely star struck the entire time and keeps a running tally of the number of celebrities that her and Ethel see. Keeping track of the number of celebrities would have been a lot easier if they had this counting app!

## If I spent more time on the project I would

- Add more styling to the buttons
- Add some better hover effects
